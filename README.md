# CUDA-Based Parallelization of the Temporal PC-algorithm with Multiple Imputation
The implementation is an extention of the [cuPC](https://github.com/LIS-Laboratory/cupc/tree/master) implementation for multiple imputations of Gaussian data, utilizing the algorithmic procedure from the [gaussMItest](https://github.com/bips-hb/micd/blob/master/R/gaussMItest.R) from the [micd](https://github.com/bips-hb/micd/) package.
It is possible to include tiered background information as seen in [tpc](https://github.com/bips-hb/tpc).
